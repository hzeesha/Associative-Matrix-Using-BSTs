# Associative Matrix Using Binary Search Trees
This project implements an associative matrix in C, where entries are indexed by a unique (string, integer) key pair. The matrix is built using a binary search tree (BST) to efficiently store and retrieve data, demonstrating advanced data structures and memory management techniques in C.
